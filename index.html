About Me:<br><br>
Since 2008, I work as a developer with a wide experience in different frameworks PHP, as well as solid knowledge also in languages like Python, Ruby, additionally handling libraries of HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript, this has made me in Full Stack developer. I`m always in constant learning. I think that one day without learning something new is a day wasted, this brings me to each day have new challenges. I have flexibility in my work, I have learned over the years that there is more than one correct way to complete an objective, I always look through the adaptability to achieve my goals in the most efficient way. Crazy in Love of the technologies, i enjoy the good practices, agile methodologies and design patterns in applications, I have as an objective the development of sites with a clean structure, with a semantics correct. I like to travel. I enjoy the contact with nature.<br><br>

Working as a Freelance gives me the possibility that a new job is a new enriching experience and at times a challenge that I will grow up as a person and as a professional. <br><br><br>

My passions are to explore and investigate new areas. For me it is exciting the know of a new language or library.<br><br>

My most recents works are:<br>
Developing Using Frameworks PHP: Yii Framework, Laravel, Symfony.
Development of ApiRest Ful with authentication by token.
Also developing and adapting for Wordpress themes.<br><br>

My Phrase: "A day without learning something new is a lost day. Fork of Charlie Chaplin: "A day without laughter is a day wasted"<br><br>
